enter_run_params.sh  -  script for storing by hand run parameters into database from new data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     -  This script allows users to enter the run parameters corresponding to 
                        all the data runs (.root) in the current directory. The information
                        entered is stored in an SQL database called gaindb in table run_params.
                     -  Having all the run parameters recorded in a database is necessary for
                        a sophisticated ananlysis of tons of data.
                     -  Simply execute this shell script and send in run numbers as input
                        parameters (can use hyphens). The script will prompt you to enter
                        the input params one by one and show a default value in parentheses.
                     -  After the run parameters have been stored, the script moves the root
                        file into the dir_processed_data directory for permanent storage.


sql_select_runs.sh  -  script for querying database for run_ids
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    -  This script allows the user to take advantage of the run_params table
                       in the gaindb database.
                    -  This script takes in SQL-style conditional arguments and uses them to
                       select a list of run id's from the database that match the conditions.
                    -  The list of selected run_ids is stored in the file selected_runs.txt.
                    -  Example usage:
                         ./sql_select_runs.sh "hv=2000 AND ll>=45 AND ll<=50 AND amp=1"
                    -  For a list of parameters to use in the conditions, type:
                         ./make_plot.sh help


sql_select_fits.sh  -  script very much like sql_select_runs.sh
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    -  This script takes in one or two parameters. If just one, then it is
                       a conditional statement for fit_results table. If two, then the first
                       condition pertains to run_params table, the second to fit_results.
                    -  This script stores a list of fit_ids in selected_fits.txt.
                    -  Example:  
                         ./sql_select_fits.sh "hv=2000 AND ll>=45" "chi < 2 AND gain > 0"


sql_select_pngs.sh  -  script very much like sql_select_runs.sh
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    -  This script takes in two parameters, stores a list of png filenames
                       in the file called selected_pngs.txt.
                    -  An optional third parameter will choose whether to view linear scale
                       plots, log scale (y-axis), or both images at once.
                    -  Example: 
                         ./sql_select_pngs.sh "hv=2000 AND ll>=45" "chi < 2 AND gain > 0" linear
                         ./sql_select_pngs.sh "hv=2000 AND ll>=45" "" log


view_selected_pngs.sh  -  This script takes no args and displays pngs from selected_pngs.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


sql_make_plot.sh  -  script for making plots via root from mysql database contents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  -  This script calls the root macro make_plot.c which takes in a list of
                     (x, y) ordered pairs and plots them in a simple TGraph.
                  -  This script takes in 4 or 5 arguments. The first two arguments are the
                     user's choice of x and y axis.
